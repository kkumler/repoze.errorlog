0.5

  - Depend on elementree 1.2.6 explicitly.
0.4

  - Add 'ignore' feature to configuration.  A value consisting of
    space-separated entry point names can be used here, indicating
    that these exception types should not be logged or kept in
    exception history.

  - Allow __error_log__ view path to be configured via 'path' entry in
    Paste configuration.

  - Place 'repoze.errorlog.path' and 'repoze.errorlog.entryid' in the
    WSGI environment to allow error-catching middleware and apps to
    compose URLs to errors.

0.3

  - 0.2 didn't work as a filter. :-(

  - Don't use zope.pagetemplate, it has too many (potentially
    conflicting) dependencies.  Instead use meld for template views.

0.2

  - Provide a TTW view (accessible via '/__error_log__') of recent
    tracebacks.

0.1

  - Initial release.
